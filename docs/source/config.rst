Configuration module
====================

In Ablator, the configuration system is used as a framework or structure for defining
experiments. With this system, Ablator creates and sets up experiments, incorporating
the appropriate configurations.

This module is divided into several submodules, all of which you can use to define
your experiment. Ablator also allows you to write your own configurations and adapt
them to your experiment's needs.
